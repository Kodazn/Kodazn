# Hi, I'm Tomiwa Fadairo

I'm a second-year Accounting and Finance student at the University of Nottingham trent.  
My long-term goal is to work in FinTech, where I can combine financial knowledge with technical skills.  
I’m also learning C++ and Python as a hobby to build games and explore software development.

## Projects

- [Tic Tac Toe in C++](https://github.com/Kodazn/TicTacToe) — my first ever programming project, built from scratch.
- More projects coming soon.

## Currently Learning

- C++ (game development fundamentals)
- Python (data + finance applications)
- Git and GitHub for version control

## About Me

- Interested in wealth management, FinTech, and digital products
- Enjoy basketball, boxing, graphic design, and self-learning
- I don’t copy-paste code — I build and learn it myself
